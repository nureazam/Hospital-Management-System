<h1>Hospital Management System</h1>
<br>
<h3>Admission</h3>
<br>

<p> A patient is admitted to the hospital by filling up a form (Attachment 1). The form data is entered into the system by an operator using a graphical user interface (to be designed by the students). In the interface, there will be some mandatory fields and some optional as mentioned in the form. After filling up and submission using the interface, all data will be saved in the database to the corresponding tables and a receipt will be printed as per Attachment 2.</p>
<br>
<h3>Doctor Initial Investigation</h3>
<br>
<p>After admission, a duty doctor will record all information of the patient as per the printed patient information form generated from the system as per Attachment 3. A nurse will submit all data recorded by the duty doctor using an Interface (to be designed by the student).</p>
<br>
<h3>Medical treatment by Specialist</h3>
<br>
<p>Each patient is admitted into the hospital under a specialist. A specialist may be Professor, Associate Professor, Asst. Professor or Consultant. Whenever, a specialist visits a patient, he/ she  advises the patient about different medicines and tests as per Attachment 4. A nurse of the ward gives the entry of the medicine and test information using an Interface (to be designed by the students). An order is prepared for medicine and for test accordingly.</p>
<br>

<p>Medicine order is sent to the medicine store and medicines are issued to the patient entering the medicine data using an interface (to be designed by the students). Medicine data contains the price of the medicine and the amount issued to that patient.</p>
<br>
<h3>Test Result</h3>
<br>
<p>Test order is sent to the Pathology/Radiology/Imaging centers as per the test order. Test samples are sent to the Pathology center if it is pathology test. For each sample, patient id is used as sample id and has a collection date and time. Test result is given sample wise. Radiology or Imaging are done by corresponding centers for different tests and results are stored as text and images.</p>
<br>
<h3>Hospital Doctor, Nurse and Ward Management</h3>
